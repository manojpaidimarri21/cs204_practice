Design an algorithm to find the smallest circle centred at origin and encloses half of a given set of points.

Input Output specification
The first line of the input is the number of test cases.
The first line of every test case indicates the number of points in the input.
If the first line of the test case is k, the next k lines contains a pair of integers signifying the x and y coordinates of the input.

Output
For each test case, there should be one number as output signifying the radius of the smallest circle centered at origin and encloses half of the given points.
